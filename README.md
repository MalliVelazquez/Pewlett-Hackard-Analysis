## Summary

For Pewlett Hackard there will come several months of transition and new hires. 30.18% of a company population is no joke, HR will have to work very hard to fill this new positions that are going to be opened. 

* First of all, we suggest to fill senior positions with internal population since this will help them to get faster the processes, and, since they already know how the company works and know the actual senior workers they could be a better candidate to fill it with great results due the velocity wich they can learn. Here, mentorship candidates can help them better since they already know ech other . 

* Since there is not enough mentors for each person that are going to retire it's important that HR creat camapaings of training with new workers and mentors in this kind of positions, not to mention that they must act quickly and find new positions candidates to be trained before retiring people start to leave in orther to move this as smooth as possible.
